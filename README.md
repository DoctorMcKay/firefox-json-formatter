# Basic JSON Formatter for Firefox

This add-on for Firefox adds a page action to the address bar for pages which contain valid JSON, enabling
you to pretty-print the page contents with a single click.

Unlike similar add-ons, this add-on does not add a fancy editor or colors or collapsibility or anything.
The page after using this formatter remains valid JSON that can be copied and pasted somewhere else; it
simply contains whitespace after formatting.
