# Basic JSON Formatter for Chromium Based Browsers

This add-on for Chromium based browsers adds an action to the browser toolbar, enabling you to pretty-print the contents
of JSON pages with a single click.

Unlike similar add-ons, this add-on does not add a fancy editor or colors or collapsibility or anything. The page after
using this formatter remains valid JSON that can be copied and pasted somewhere else; it simply contains whitespace
after formatting.
