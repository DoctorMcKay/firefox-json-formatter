# Basic JSON Formatter for Firefox/Edge

This add-on for Firefox and Edge adds a page action to the address bar for pages which contain valid JSON, enabling
you to pretty-print the page contents with a single click.

Unlike similar add-ons, this add-on does not add a fancy editor or colors or collapsibility or anything.
The page after using this formatter remains valid JSON that can be copied and pasted somewhere else; it
simply contains whitespace after formatting.

Source for the MS Edge version is available in the [ms-edge branch](https://github.com/DoctorMcKay/firefox-json-formatter/tree/ms-edge).
